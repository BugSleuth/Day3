#100 DAYS Coding Challange.
The learning from Day3 are as follows. 
Learned about Control flow in Python. If else syntax,Multiple if else,Learned to modfiy exixisitng If else with New requirement. 
From flow chart to How to do coding for contol flow.

Challange#1
Person can Ride the rollarcoaster with hight equal or grater then 120 CM.Otherwise he wil not allow to ride.
then added some more parameters for amount.
if age is below 18 then need to pay $7

Learning From above challange is
1. Takeing input from user.
2. evaluate the price based on user input and calculated the amount correclty through code only.
   First i tried to code it with hard coded values based on my own calculation. but later i found the way to code with the help of python.

Challange#3
TresureHunt game
Where i have develope the code based on flow chart.


One extra thing i did is To push my Code trough pycharm(IDE) to Github Repo
Step i followd when pushing my code
How to Push code to Github Repository
1.Open Pycharm
2.Select VCS option.
3.Enable Version control.
4.Git
5.Then GO to github and Create repository.
6.Copy the HTTP URL.
7.Opne the pycharm again. Select option Git>Clone
8.Enter Username and passwrod.
9.Select option Commit
10. Enter Relavant message and hit commit.
11. Once commit done select option to push the code.
12. Code will be pushed to Github Remote Repository.

For TresureHunt.py file i have two version of the code
1.First vesrison have Logical Operator or in codition while evaluating User Input. whether user typed in lower case or upper or Proper.
2.second vesrion i removed the Redudent code for Logical operator. inseted i used Python inbuild function lower() to convert user input to Lower case. and then directly compare it in if condition.
earlier in if condition need to use both upper and lower condtion. but lower gives the good handling user input capabiltiy.
